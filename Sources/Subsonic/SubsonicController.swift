// SubsonicController.swift
// Part of Subsonic, a simple library for playing sounds in SwiftUI
//
// This file contains the main SubsonicController class, which handles
// imperatively playing audio from any view, by calling play().
// It also wraps up the code to prepare audio from a bundle, which is
// used both here and in `SubsonicPlayerModifier`.
